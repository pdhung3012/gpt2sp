DURACLOUD-824,Sync Tool: Ability to restart on system reboot,"This task is to provide a way, on Windows, Mac, and Linux systems for a Sync Tool that is running on shutdown to restart and continue running after a system restart.",3,1.6387091
DURACLOUD-825,S3StorageProvider: Remove dependency on a particular access key,"The S3StorageProvider makes use of the AWS access key as a prefix for bucket names, just to guarantee that the names are unique. The listing of buckets is also limited to only those with a matching access key.  Now that AWS does not make the secret key (essentially the password) available, if we were to lose the secret key, we would have to create another credential pair. If we were to do that, though, the S3StorageProvider would show an empty space listing because the new access key will not match the bucket prefix. This also currently makes it impossible to use the AWS IAM service, which is a best practice.  This task is to allow the S3StorageProvider to display and work with buckets regardless of the access key prefix. The prefix should still be used, since uniqueness is still necessary, and should still be stripped before displaying the space names for users. However, rather than requiring a specific access key, any key should work.  Since this match will likely require a regex: According to AWS docs, the Access Key ID is a 20-character, alphanumeric sequence.",2,1.254368
DURACLOUD-826,Retrieval Tool: Use logback for logging,"In DURACLOUD-774 (in particular, the changes in code r1072) changed over the Sync Tool from using log4j to using logback as the underlying logger. This task is to update the Retrieval Tool in the same way.",1,2.1809525
DURACLOUD-827,add sync tool prepend source path (include top level directory) flag to synctoolui,,1,0.92786926
DURACLOUD-828,Retrieval Tool: Hidden password option,DURACLOUD-759 added a hidden password for the Sync Tool. This task is to make use of the same environment variable to pick up the password for the Retrieval Tool. This will help to keep the functionality of the two tools in sync.,1,1.6421196
DURACLOUD-831,Support multiple instances of synctool ui on one machine,"Currently the synctoolui assumes only one user per machine will be using the synctool.  If this assumption is incorrect, we may need to look into adding port negotiation into the installer mix to enable multiple installs of the synctoolui on a single machine.",2,0.9432076
DURACLOUD-832,RetrievalTool NullPointerException when using all spaces option (-a),"The retrievaltool throws a NullPointerException when using the ""all-spaces"" or ""-a"" command line option and the ""spaces"" or ""-s"" option is not specified, which the ""spaces"" option shouldn't need to be when using ""all-spaces"".  The culprit is in RetrievalTool#startRetrievalManager at the line: boolean createSpaceDir = retConfig.getSpaces().size() > 1; because RetrievalToolConfig#getSpaces returns null when the ""spaces"" command line option is not used.",1,1.7546307
DURACLOUD-833,synctoolui: unchecking options in configuration tab causes 404 error,The problem:  the controller dependends on the presence of property name in query param while uncheck form fields are not sent as empty values.  ,1,1.7327783
DURACLOUD-837,List MD5 option for space listing function of Retrieval Tool,It would be nice to be able to optionally list all the md5s as well as the raw list of contentIds for a space.,1,1.458269
DURACLOUD-838,"List contents of space from a ""pre-chunked"" point of view (Retrieval Tool)","It would be handy to be able to optionally list a space contents as it  will appear when retrieved.  That is, only list contentIds as they will appear after they are restitched (do not show chunks or manifests).  It's a kind of dry run for the retrieval tool in a way.",1,1.674729
DURACLOUD-839,Retrieval Tool:  Verify chunked manifests when generating prechunked listing,"It would be nice if we could tell the retrieval tool to verify that the manifest points to a complete set of chunks and that the chunk md5s match the manifest md5s.    This will be a handy addition to  https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DURACLOUD-837 and https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DURACLOUD-838  In verify mode, it would probably be a good idea to add a couple of columns to the output: verification status (success, failure) and an explanation column where there is a problem. ",1,1.1829289
DURACLOUD-841,Image gallery viewer,"In a cloud service strategy meeting on Aug 6, 2013 (https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPINT/2013-08-06+-+Cloud+Service+Strategy) there was a discussion about a need expressed by UNC to have a way to view images in DuraCloud as a gallery, in order to aid in the finding of images in their collection.  I was thinking that this could be accomplished with an html/css/javascript app that is stored in one of the user's spaces, and allows them to select a space (if that's actually necessary, could be hard coded to the one that is their image library) and view a set of images. The javascript would need to make calls to the DuraCloud REST API to get the list of content items and display each one. The images would likely be scaled down a bit, to make browsing easier, and clicking on them would display the (slightly) larger size. The REST API would also be used to allow paging through the content items (and not trying to display too many at once). The option to specify a prefix for filtering would need to be there, and the user would need to be able to see the full content ID of the item they are viewing, since that will be the link back to the full size archival image on their internal system.  There is an expectation that the UNC folks will be generating the necessary low-res images that would be viewed through this gallery viewer, and would load those images into a DuraCloud space.",2,1.9528222
DURACLOUD-842,DurAdmin: Uploaded files should include same metadata as generated by Sync Tool,"When adding files, the Sync Tool captures metadata for the files. DurAdmin should capture the same metadata. The metadata items created by the Sync Tool includes: - creator - content-file-last-accessed - content-file-path - content-file-modified - content-file-created",1,1.522149
DURACLOUD-843,Make use of S3 Server Side Encryption,This task is to update the S3StorageProvider to make use of the Server Side Encryption feature provided by S3 (http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2011/10/04/amazon-s3-announces-server-side-encryption-support/)  Implementation details: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/SSEUsingJavaSDK.html  Storing content with encryption should be the default.  Another task will be needed to update existing content in S3 to make use of encryption. This will likely need to be done by performing a copy action on all existing content such that the copied item is encrypted as it is written to S3.,2,1.2401017
DURACLOUD-844,Sync Tool: Uninstalling with app running (on Windows) pops up error dialog,"If the sync tool is uninstalled while the application is running, the uninstall works properly, the application is stopped and all files are removed as expected, but an error dialog is popped up stating ""Program ended with an error exit code"".   This popup does not show up if the application is not running when the uninstaller is run.  The dialog is popped up when the command: ""taskkill /f /t /im duracloudsync.exe"" is run by the uninstaller.  In testing for the 2.4 release I found that if the taskkill command is run without the ""/f"" force flag, the error dialog does not pop up and the exe process stops (the icon is removed from the task bar), but the java process continues to run, so the application is still available. If the command above, with the force flag is then run, the java app is stopped without a popup dialog. This is why a second call was added to the uninstaller, to try running without the force flag first. Unfortunately, this did not work, the error dialog remains.",2,1.3244478
DURACLOUD-846,Update to the latest JClouds,In DuraCloud release 2.4 an issue with the JClouds library that was used (the latest at the time) was that it would not perform reauthentication when the auth token expired. This required a work around in DuraStore. The issue has now been fixed: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JCLOUDS-178.  This task is to update to the latest JClouds library when possible.,1,1.8478733
DURACLOUD-847,SyncTool/StoreClient failing when attempting to connect to a DuraCloud instance with a configured Glacier provider,"From ucar customer, when attempting to run the sync tool (version 2.1.0) against a DuraCloud 2.4 instance with a Glacier storage provider configured, the following error appears:  Starting up the Sync Tool ...Exception in thread ""main"" java.lang.RuntimeException: Could not create connection to DuraStore due to Error retrieving content stores. null at org.duracloud.sync.util.StoreClientUtil.createContentStore(StoreClientUtil.java:40) at org.duracloud.sync.SyncTool.startSyncManager(SyncTool.java:148) at org.duracloud.sync.SyncTool.runSyncTool(SyncTool.java:292) at org.duracloud.sync.SyncTool.main(SyncTool.java:355) Caused by: org.duracloud.error.ContentStoreException: Error retrieving content stores. null at org.duracloud.client.ContentStoreManagerImpl.getStorageAccounts(ContentStoreManagerImpl.java:164) at org.duracloud.client.ContentStoreManagerImpl.getPrimaryContentStore(ContentStoreManagerImpl.java:118) at org.duracloud.sync.util.StoreClientUtil.createContentStore(StoreClientUtil.java:37) ... 3 more Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException at org.duracloud.storage.domain.StorageAccountManager.initialize(StorageAccountManager.java:50) at org.duracloud.client.ContentStoreManagerImpl.getStorageAccounts(ContentStoreManagerImpl.java:152) ... 5 more",1,1.271117
DURACLOUD-848,Bulk Select/Delete Tool,"Several customers have requested the need for a tool that will allow them to perform a bulk delete of a subset of content in a space. They need a tool that will allow them to, first, specify which content to delete from a space and then, second, perform a bulk delete for that content.",1,1.9186454
DURACLOUD-851,Add CORS headers to apache config in new AMI,Add the CORS headers to the apache config when the new ami is built:  See  https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DPS-23 for modifications.  This change enables api calls to be made from javascript hosted on other domains.,1,0.964881

DURACLOUD-861,Modify duradmin to control streaming service via ContentStore interface and space properties,,2,1.1498513
DURACLOUD-862,Remove services system,"This work is to remove all of the services from DuraCloud. This should include removing DuraService, the entire set of existing services, and components (like the executor) which support or depend on services.",3,2.2652724
DURACLOUD-863,Remove ActiveMQ,This work is to remove the use of ActiveMQ in DuraCloud. Storage events should be now captured by the AuditStorageProvider.,2,2.2245734
DURACLOUD-864,Update media streaming to work without Media Streamer service,The Media Streamer service is being removed. Media streaming still needs to work. This task is to allow the existing S3StorageProvider streaming Tasks handle the work the service used to manage.,2,3.7836628
DURACLOUD-865,Create AuditStorageProvider to push AuditTasks to audit queue,"An AuditStorageProvider needs to be created which is a decorator for StorageProvider. This new class will capture read and write events and write them to an SQS queue as AuditTasks, to be processed later.  Note that this item overlaps with DURACHRON-35.",5,0.75270116
DURACLOUD-866,Set up local logging to capture read and write storage actions,The AuditStorageProvider already captures read and write events. This work is to have that information written out to local log files,1,1.9056987
DURACLOUD-867,Space listing not being displayed in Chrome browser,"When loading the DurAdmin application in the Google Chrome browser, the list of spaces is not displayed. If there are multiple providers configured, selecting a different provider from the dropdown, and then returning to the primary provider allows the spaces listing to show up. If there is only one configured storage provider, there is no clear way to get the spaces listing to display.",1,0.69238675
DURACLOUD-868,Upgrade from Maven2 to Maven3,Upgrade from Maven2 to Maven3. Update POMs to be compatible with Maven3.  Fix all build warnings and errors.,3,1.105527
DURACLOUD-869,Sync Tool: add content ID prefix option,"In a discussion with NCDCR, they noted that they would like to be able to break up their data set, and perform syncs at lower levels in their path hierarchy, but are prevented from doing so because they would like the full directory path to be included in the content ID. Currently, the only way to do this is (in a Windows environment) to either run the Sync/Upload tool from a high level directory, or move content around. Moving content around, in their production storage system is not practical.  The new feature requested to resolve this problem: Allow for a prefix option, that would be prepended on all content items being transferred.  To keep this simple, the prefix provided would apply to all files in all specified content directories.",2,1.547432
DURACLOUD-873,SyncToolUI: Option to set threads,The UI for the SyncTool should provide an option to set the number of threads used for processing. This can just be a drop-down box on the configuration screen.  ,3,1.1582766
DURACLOUD-874,SyncToolUI: Option to include prefix,DURACLOUD-869 added a prefix option to the SyncTool. This task is to provide a way for users of the UI to make use of that new feature.,1,1.6212666
DURACLOUD-876,Create 3.0.1 AMI,Updates: - Use 3.0.1 code baseline - Add lumberjack - Update ssh users - Root pw - SSL cert update,1,1.8729466
DURACLOUD-877,Provide a way by which users can determine the optimal SyncTool thread setting,"Currently, to determine the ideal number of threads to maximize throughput, users of the SyncTool need to run the SyncRate tool with a variety of settings, record the speed values, then compare them. This is time consuming and difficult. This task is to make determining the thread number for optimal throughput as simple as possible.",3,1.5686392
DURACLOUD-879,Update mimetype determination method,"The MimetypeUtil class in common currently uses FileNameMap (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/net/FileNameMap.html) to determine the mimetype of a file based on its file extension. This class is used by the SyncTool to generate mimetype values for files being transferred to DuraCloud. The current method depends on a mapping file found in each individual user's JRE, make it difficult to update.  A better option would be to use MimetypesFileTypeMap (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/activation/MimetypesFileTypeMap.html) for this purpose, which would allow us to include our own mapping file (and therefore be much more comprehensive).",1,1.8725823
DURACLOUD-880,Media streaming URL not being displayed in space properties,"When media streaming is turned on for a space, a property is added to the space tags called ""streaming-host"" which provides the host value needed to stream the files in the space (this change was made for DURACLOUD-864).   Unfortunately, as of the 3.1.0 release, DurAdmin is not displaying the streaming host value as one of the space properties, so users cannot actually use streaming even after it has been turned on.",1,1.1568924
DURACLOUD-881,Cannot configure or turn off logging of Retrier in ContentStoreImpl,"The ContentStoreImpl currently has hardcoded settings for how it logs errors encountered during ""retries"".  Unfortunately, this is not ideal for all use cases of the API.  For example, in the Replication Task Suite, we use ContentStoreImpl.getContentProperties() method as a way to tell whether content already exists in DuraCloud. If that content does not exist, we expect to receive a NotFoundException. This lets us perform logic like: ""If content exists in DuraCloud, see what checksum DuraCloud reports. If DuraCloud checksum differs from local checksum, re-upload the content.""  Unfortunately, however, getContentProperties() logs this same warning message to log4j 4 times in a row (1 + 3 retries) if the content does NOT yet exist in DuraCloud:  2014-07-14 16:46:28,336 WARN  org.duracloud.client.ContentStoreImpl @ Error attempting to get properties 'ITEM@10673-10.zip' in 'dspace-dev-backup' due to: Response code was 404, expected value was 200. Response body value: null  This causes the logs for the Replication Task Suite to actually fill up with unnecessary warnings from the DuraCloud v3.1.1 API. For example, anytime we want to upload NEW content to DuraCloud, we first check if it already exists (which logs that error x 4) before the new content is uploaded. The logged warnings would cause unnecessary worry for anyone looking at the logs -- in reality they are harmless in this scenario, as the content obviously doesn't exist before it is first uploaded.  It looks like the WARN message is generated by ""doGetContentProperties"" here: https://github.com/duracloud/duracloud/blob/master/storeclient/src/main/java/org/duracloud/client/ContentStoreImpl.java#L904  It is then repeated 4 times as a ""log.warn"" in the default execute() method (which is configured to do 3 retries): https://github.com/duracloud/duracloud/blob/master/storeclient/src/main/java/org/duracloud/client/ContentStoreImpl.java#L216  Ideally, there should be some way to configure the logging in the ContentStoreImpl. I like that this same task is retried 3 times. But in many scenarios, I'd rather it just throw me a final Error if all retries failed, rather than logging the same error message multiple times in a row.   If logging cannot be easily configurable, then switching the default execute() method to just do a ""log.debug"" would be better. That way I can see the underlying error if I turn on debugging, but by default my logs don't get filled with the same errors repeated.  NOTE: This was discovered while attempting to upgrade the DSpace Replication Task Suite to use DuraCloud API version 3.1.1 (JARS: storeclient, storeprovider, common). Unfortunately, until logging is cleaned up in some way, it's unlikely I'll release the upgraded Replication Task Suite code.",2,1.4525225
DURACLOUD-882,Fixity check green bar not being displayed,The green bar that show the date of the last fixity check is not being displayed in DuraCloud 3.1. This feature needs to be re-instated as the new bit integrity system is put in place to allow users to see the dates of health checks.,3,1.267713
DURACLOUD-884,Better handling for content files added with an incorrect checksum,"Currently when a content item is added to a storage provider via a PUT content REST call, if the checksum included with that content item does not match the checksum computed by the provider, a 500 response is generated, and the file itself remains on the storage provider.  This task is to: 1. Ensure that if content fails the checksum check, it is either not added to or is removed from the space. 2. Return a response with an error code and body text that better describes the issue.",3,1.2239497
DURACLOUD-885,Limit storage provider details,"The current DuraCloud REST API call to determine the available storage providers on an instance provides in its response the set of properties from init that are beyond the standard set of StorageProvider values. In the case of the SnapshotStorageProvider, some of these details should not be shared.",1,0.80723596
DURACLOUD-886,Restricted Streaming,"- DuraCloud would continue to use CloudFront to stream files, but would add an option to limit access to streamed content. There would be two options when setting a space to be streamed: open streaming (which is how we do streaming now) and restricted streaming.(the new feature). - When using restricted streaming, no files would be directly accessible. Instead, to expose a file, a new DuraCloud REST method would be provided which could be called to retrieve a signed URL that could then be used to stream the file. - The new REST call would require providing the username and password of a DuraCloud user with administrative rights. - The new REST call would require an ending date and time parameter, after which the returned URL is no longer valid. - The new REST call would allow for providing an optional parameter indicating the IP address or range of addresses that can be used to access the content.  The consumer of this service (UNC in this case) will be responsible for: - Verifying that a user of their system should have access to the content that is to be streamed - Making the call to DuraCloud (with appropriate DuraCloud permissions) to request and retrieve the signed URL - Inserting the URL into an RTMP player (e.g. Flowplayer, JWPlayer, etc) which will allow the user to view the content",8,1.822993
DURACLOUD-887,User IP limits,"- DuraCloud would add a new user attribute which defines an IP address or range (using CIDR notation) - Once this attribute for a user is filled out, all future attempts to log in as that user (both in DuraCloud instances and the Management Console) would require that the user be coming from that IP address or range. - Users would be able to update this attribute in the Management Console. - Note: This feature would need to support multiple IP address/range entries, as there could be 2 or 3 specific IPs where the user needs to be able to log in from.",3,0.8702412
DURACLOUD-888,Make Audit and Manifest REST methods consistent with other durastore calls,"Namely, make sure that storeID parameter can be null and if so, the primary storage provider is used.",1,1.3206639
DURACLOUD-890,Problem running the latest synctool installer works on osx mavericks,"Michele was having trouble launching the installer 3.1.1 on Mavericks.  At first it seemed that the problem was the lack of java.  Danny had her install java 8.  Still no luck.  Danny was able to reproduce: Symptoms:   After downloading the latest synctool installer (3.1.1), double clicking on the icon appears to do nothing.

DURACLOUD-896,Add SyncTool feature which allows for skipping existance checks for new content sets,"This feature allows initial transfers of data sets to proceed without the usual checks to see if the content is already in DuraCloud (since we know that it is not.) Instead, all files will simply be transferred.  The need for this feature comes from GSU. With a large set of small files (4.7 million under 1 MB), the overhead of doing the checks for each file was slowing down the overall transfer considerably. ",2,1.394307
DURACLOUD-897,Add REST API for Accessing Bit Integrity Reports in DuraStore,"The rest api should support a call to get the last bit integrity report for a space.  It should include, along with the body of the latest report, the status of the report (success if all went well, failure if there are errors) as well as the date the report was completed.  The properties should be accessible through a HEAD call, while the content (as well as properties) will be accessed with a GET.   ",2,0.90518075

DURACLOUD-903,Clicking content checkbox unexpectedly deselects after loading the content detail ,Steps to reproduce:    1. Load a space in duradmin  2. Make sure no content items are selected.  3. Click on the checkbox next to a content item.  4. Notice that it is initially checked but then unchecks itself while remaining selected.,1,1.1215656
DURACLOUD-904,SyncTool: Make sure files restored from change list on re-start are in the current set of content directories,"An issue reported by NCDCR:  The SyncTool performed a restart and picked up an old change list file even though the set of content directories was completely different. This happened because the SyncTool was started (writing the config) then killed before the old change list could be overwritten. On the next run, the config matched, so a restarted was carried out, pulling in change list files which really should have been ignored.    To fix this problem, the proposal is add a check on restart, just after the change list is read in, to remove any files from the change list that don't actually exist in the list of content directories.",1,1.3455046
DURACLOUD-910,Clicking on the checkbox next to a space causes the application to hang.,To reproduce the issue:    Open duradmin.  Select a single space by clicking on the checkbox.  Notice that the throbber spins continuously.  ,1,0.9081259
DURACLOUD-911,Failure with space and %20 in content ID on SDSC,"Several failures have been noted recently in the mill when attempting to perform a duplication of a content item with a content ID that includes ""%20"" in the content ID from Amazon to SDSC. (Note that %20 is the url encoding for a blank space.) The attached file is a set of errors from the mill dead letter queue.    I was able to reproduce the issue by attempting to create a content item in SDSC with the name: ""test-file spaces%20percents.txt"". Note that I did not see an issue with ""test-file spaces.txt"" or ""test-file%20percents.txt"", so it would appear that the combination of the two characters (an actual space, and ""%20"") is necessary to provoke the issue.",2,1.1351928
DURACLOUD-912,Copy dialog in UI has multiple progress spinners next to space selection,"As shown in the attached image, when performing a copy via DurAdmin, multiple spinning circles to indicate loading or progress are shown next to the space drop-down selection. This becomes more of an issue when the storage provider selection is used to change the selected provider.    Previously, there was one of these spinners, which was present as the list of spaces was generated and then went away one the list was populated. That was great. Now when I transition between storage providers, a string of these are presented (I've counted at least 9) with overlapping text (making the text impossible to read). Some of the spinners do disappear, but 2 seem to remain even after the space listing is fully populated.",1,1.5120416

DURACLOUD-915,SyncTool UI: Add warning about use of the sync deletes feature,It has been noted several times that the sync deletes feature in the SyncTool can be dangerous. It provides the opportunity for a user to delete their entire corpus of content if it's not used carefully.    This task is to add a warning dialog when anyone selects the option to turn on the sync deletes feature which describes the dangers and asks them if they are sure this is what they would like to do.,1,2.18806
DURACLOUD-916,Secure streaming cannot be turned back on in DurAdmin,"If a space is set to secure streaming it shows up in DurAdmin as having streaming turned on.

DURACLOUD-917,Storage report display values are inconsistent,"The storage report charts in the DurAdmin display do not show consistent values between the line chart (historical size) and the pie charts. This inconsistency is because one of the two uses GiB (Gibibytes) and the other uses GB (Gigabytes). A GiB is 1024^3 bytes, while a GB is 1000^3 bytes.    This issue should be resolved by updating the storage reports to make use of GB rather than GiB. This will provide greater consistency.    Note that this is also an issue reported in DURACHRON-79, where the inconsistency is between the storage reports and the snapshot.",1,1.1743586
DURACLOUD-919,Durastore init xml is incorrect in the documentation.,This chunk is not right.    <storageProviderAccounts>    <storageAcct ownerId='0' isPrimary='true'>...</storageAcct>    <storageAudit>...</storageAudit>    <millDbConfig>...</millDbConfig>  </storageProviderAccounts>    millDbConfig and storageAudit should be siblings of storageProviderAccounts.    See xml document for correct format.,1,0.8361844
DURACLOUD-923,Add byte-range option to DuraStore get content REST API request,"Discussions with Ilya Kreymer from webrecorder.io have suggested that there could be an integration with that service to allow playback of WARC files directly from DuraCloud storage, which could be quite beneficial for Archive-It users storing content in DuraCloud.    In order to make this happen, the DuraStore API needs to support range requests, allowing for only portions of a file to be retrieved from storage, rather than the entire file. This is supported in S3 and OpenStack Swift, so should be something we can support across all providers.",3,1.2502578
DURACLOUD-924,Instance not initialized call should return something other than a 503,Each of the DuraCloud apps currently responds to a /init REST call with either a 200 if the app is initialized and ready for use or a 503 if the app is available but not yet initialized.    This task is to update this to change the 503 to another code. The reason is that Apache also returns 503 responses as a DuraCloud instance is starting when it is not yet able to make a connection to Tomcat. This results in the Management Console thinking that an instance is ready to be initialized when  it is not yet available.    Note that this change will require a companion change in the MC to ensure that the correct HTTP code is expected on init.,1,0.9929184
DURACLOUD-928,Allow user-level users to see bit integrity notice and manifest button,Users with USER role should be able to see the bit integrity notice and should be able to see and use the space manifest button. Currently these are only available to users with ADMIN role or above.,1,1.308692
DURACLOUD-929,Multiple space selection does not work,"In DuraCloud v3.3.0, when multiple spaces are selected, the UI displays as if no spaces were selected. There is no option to delete the selected spaces or edit properties (as there was in 3.2.2 and previous versions)    To reproduce:    1. Select a space.  2. Click on the checkbox of another space.  3. The multiple space selection panel does not show up in the detail area.",1,1.6519555
DURACLOUD-930,Turning off space streaming clears space permissions,"On a space with streaming enabled, setting streaming to off (via the UI) will cause the bucket property which maintains space permissions to be removed. This effectively deletes all space permissions (making the space and the contents of the space unavailable to anyone beyond administrators).     Note that this clearing of permissions is not immediately reflected in the UI, as the permissions set is cached.",1,1.0221545
DURACLOUD-935,Audit and Manifest links fail in duradmin when space id has a period in it.,"To reproduce  1. Add a space with a period (such as ""test.space1"") and then add a couple of items to it.  2. Wait a minute.    3. Click on manifest or audit links   4. Page will return blank without downloading a file.    Problem may be that spring is parsing everything to the right of the period in order to serve up content based on the apparent file type extension.  Problem does not exist in durastore - in duradmin only.  ",1,0.795472
DURACLOUD-936,Durastore incorrectly reports duplicate space.,"To reproduce the issue:     1. create a space called ""my-space""  2. create a space called ""my.space""  3. the second call should fail and report a duplicate space.    Note that performing the above calls in reverse order succeeds.    Finally,  after performing call in reverse order, notice that deleting the my.space  results in both my.space and my-space being deleted.",1,1.5125808
DURACLOUD-939,Relax check for existing content ID on streaming url request,"In order to successfully stream an mp3 file through Cloudfront, the file must be stored with the "".mp3"" extension, but the task call to generate the URL must leave the extension off of the file.    Example: If a file is named ""myAudioFile.mp3"", it should be stored in DuraCloud (S3 provider) with that name. To stream that file, the content ID would be specified as: ""myAudioFile"", without the extension.    Right now there is a check in the task calls to create URLs to verify that the specified content ID actually exists. In the example above, this causes problems because the stored file name and the ID provided for the get URL call differ.    This task is to change the task code to skip the content ID check altogether. This will also allow for generating URLs for content items which have not yet been uploaded (but for which the IDs are known).    Note that I've only tested this with secure streaming, but expect it will work the same with open streaming.",1,1.2153565
DURACLOUD-940,Bit Integrity Reports are not showing up in duradmin for secondary providers.,"(from an email from bbranan)  I was looking at some bit integrity results this morning and noticed in all of the accounts I looked at (colum, icpsr, and demo), that there are no green bit integrity bars on any of the spaces in any secondary providers. I spot checked a few, and there are successful bit report entries for those spaces in the mill db, they just aren't being shown in the UI.    When I select a space on SDSC providers in duradmin, it takes a while for the space to load. It appears to be attempting to get the bit integrity report, but it fails to do so. Looking at the logs, I see consistent errors like this:    ERROR  2015/09/11 13:26:40 [ajp-bio-8009-exec-25212] (SpaceController.java:117) [populateBitIntegrityResults()] - failed to populate bit integrity results due to error:Error attempting to get bit integrity report  properties 'carissa-folder-test' due to: Response code was 500, expected value was 200.

DURACLOUD-941,Streaming: Allow streaming URL requests for content IDs not in storage,"In order to stream mp3 files through Cloudfront, the files themselves must have the "".mp3"" file extension, but the streaming URL must be requested without the file extension. Currently, there is a check to make sure that a call to get a streaming URL corresponds to a content ID already in storage. In this case, though, the content ID and the ""stream"" ID don't quite match.    This task is to remove the check to see if a content ID is in place before a streaming URL can be requested. This should solve the problem noted above, and make it possible to pre-generate URLs for content files prior to upload, which may be useful as well.",1,2.0704942
DURACLOUD-942,Add support for S3 - Infrequently Accessed storage option,"According to this announcement: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-storage-update-new-lower-cost-s3-storage-option-glacier-price-reduction/?sc_ichannel=em&sc_icountry=global&sc_icampaigntype=launch&sc_icampaign=em_148542750&sc_idetail=em_2049897831&ref_=pe_430550_148542750_7, Amazon is now offering the option of a lower cost S3 tier for infrequently accessed data. This task is to transition all DuraCloud content to this new option.    The best way to take advantage of S3 - IA is via bucket lifecycle policies. Because of the additional cost of content deletes in the first 30 days, it would be best to set these policies to transition content from S3 Standard storage to S3 - IA storage after the content has been stored for 30 days. This policy should be created when a new space is created (via the S3StorageProvider)    As part of this work, the current S3 task which transitions content to Reduced Redundancy storage should be replaced with a task that adds the bucket policy for S3 - IA to an existing bucket. To complete this transition, a script will need to be written which uses this task to update all current accounts.    The storage class init parameter should also be removed (from both app-config, and from the MC). It no longer makes sense to support reduced redundancy storage.",2,1.6008183
DURACLOUD-946,Use CloudWatch rather than DuraBoss to generate storage reports,"Cloudwatch now provides metrics for S3, providing a daily total of files and total size per bucket in an account. We need to use this rather than running DuraBoss for reporting, at least on S3 and Glacier stores. Ideally we can discontinue the use of DuraBoss completely.",5,1.7002014
DURACLOUD-949,Beanstalk: Connect DuraStore to MC database,"In order to have all of the information that is needed, DuraStore in beanstalk will need to have a direct connection to the MC database. Much of the code for setting up this connection should be already available from the MC or Mill (share/reuse where possible).    Options for getting the database connection information:  - As system properties specified in JAVA_OPTS (using beanstalk environment variables, note that there is a 256 character limit)  - Use JAVA_OPTS to point to a config file S3 URL, and pull that in on startup.    In order for the DuraStore calls to complete quickly, and to keep the database load down, information from the DB should be cached. This could be done preemptively or lazily, but in either case, there will need to be handling for invalidation, to ensure updates to the database are picked up.",2,1.5253074

DURACLOUD-954,Users with USER role should be able to view streams on open spaces,"When a space is set to open streaming (by turning streaming on via DurAdmin), any user with read access to that space should be able to view media (audio/video) that is streamed through the built-in player. Currently, this works fine for admin users, but users with only USER role just see ""Unable to stream file"" where the player should be.    This is very likely to be caused by the fact that a task call is being made to retrieve the streaming URL, but that task call is limited to admin users. A user with access to a space should be able to make the task request to stream content from that space.",1,1.1509408
DURACLOUD-957,Backup thread runs too frequently on synctool.,Currently the synctool's backup thread is running on the same schedule as the directory polling period which is 10 seconds by default.  The back up thread period should not be tied to the polling period.  Instead it should run at least every 5 minutes by default.  Also thread synchronization on on the ChangedList.persist method is causing threads to wait until the backup file is completely written rather than waiting only until the file list is copied in memory.,1,1.0249319

These issues were identified for  jclouds 1.8.0 (the version we're using) in this jira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JCLOUDS-217 .  According to the issue details it was resolved in jclouds 2.0.0.   Short term solution is to apply the fix to the OpenStackStorageProvider.

DURACLOUD-1020,Move Bit Integrity Producer on to the Sentinel,In order to better utilize our AWS resources we should do the following:      1. Retire the Bit Integrity Producer  Autoscale group and configuration.  2. Move the bit integrity producer process onto the sentinel and have it run continuously.  3. Upgrade the sentinel to an m3.medium.   4. Ensure that the bit report autoscale group is scaling down when the bit report queue has been empty for more than 3 hours.,2,1.0784343
DURACLOUD-1021,Mill: Dup Task Processor should perform delete on destination only if the source does not contain item.,"In order to cover the case of content disappearing (due to provider failure) from the source provider we must make sure to delete destination store content only if the content is no longer in the source manifest.  Currently if a dup task comes to dup content from a source to a dest provider, if the item doesn't exist in the primary we delete it in the destination.   However  the looping dup producer adds dup messages for items not in the source that are in the destination in order to synchronize any missed deletes.   Thus a file that disappears from the source unexpectedly will be deleted resulting in data loss.    So to fix this problem: if dup task targets a content item that does not exist in the source provider,  ensure that it is not in the source manifest before deleting from destination.",2,0.8634927
DURACLOUD-1024,"In the CleanUpSnapshotTask,  read all items before generating delete messages","Currently the CleanupSnapshot task streams manifest items using a streaming iterator.  For each item, a  delete audit message is generated.  Under the covers the manifest item streamer pulls items in 10K item pages.   If the manifest processor in the mill begins working the list before all pages have been pulled,  the manifest streamer will miss some records.    To resolve,  write entire list of content Ids to file before generating audit tasks.",1,1.0136647
