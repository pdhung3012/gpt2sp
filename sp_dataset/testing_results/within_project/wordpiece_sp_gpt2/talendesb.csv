TESB-10335,The cLog component is severely impaired,"Assuming people here are all around Java programmers I wont gush over the merits of Java Logging frameworks...    The *Camel* [_*{{log:}}*_ endpoint|http://camel.apache.org/log.html] - which the *cLog* component creates - has as the first parameter _*loggingCategory*_ (or logger name) and is exemplified right in the first example.  If I set this cLog logging level to *{{DEBUG}}* then I can later issue this command in *_trun_ console*: {code}karaf@trun> log:set DEBUG loggingCategory{code} to cause *just* that logger category to show in _*{{tesb.log}}*_.    The problem is that the TOS-ESB generates the endpoint uri with _*loggingCategory*_ := _*<component label>*_ (ex. *cLog_1*), which is of course useless.  A possible proper default would be something like: _*loggingCategory*_ := _*<project name>*_._*<route name>*_._*<component label>*_    You may perhaps even consider making it a settable user options for the *cLog* component.",1,1.7633055

TESB-10378,RS and WS client should be able to auto-follow same URI redirects,"CXF client runtime can be configured to auto-follow redirects.  Generally speaking it might present a security concern, example, we invoke on ""http://host1/service"" and we get redirected to ""http://host33/service"", note a completely different host. In this case it make sense to work with redirects directly, example, as proposed in https://jira.talendforge.org/browse/TESB-10377.    However, very often, we have same URI redirects (I believe it is to prevent spams, etc), for example,   we invoke on ""http://host1/service"" and we get redirected to ""http://host1/service?a=b"", I saw it with my demos and also saw reports from CXF WS users.    Proposal: in advanced properties, add 'follow same URL redirects' or similar, disabled by default.

For tESBConsumer:  - add checkbox 'Use Business Correlation' and field 'value' where user can set correlation value (default is empty, in this case id will be generated on runtime).

TESB-10959,Can not create service reference using blueprint for sam agent and locator features (Only Investigate a solution),The sam agent and locator features are currently publishing OSGi services that can be referenced in user bundles to add the features to endpoints and clients.    The problem is that the features are published with their concrete classes. This has two problems:  1. The user bundle needs to know the impl class name which should rather be hidden as an implementation detail  2. Blueprint create a proxy for each service it imports/references. This is not possible for concrete classes. Probably it can work using asm but this is a sure cause of headaches.    So I propose to additionally publish these features with the interface org.apache.cxf.feature.Feature. To identify them I propose to add a property id with these values:  locator: id=org.talend.esb.locator.feature  sam: id=org.talend.esb.sam.feature    I will add a patch.

TESB-11187,EventLogging: Improve database structure of Event Logging SQL database,"Just like the SAM database structure the Event logging structure is far away from being optimal.  Considering the possibly _large_ number of records the may end up inside the SQL tables esp. the primary keys / index definitions should be reconsidered.  Note that this discussion is based on the default DDL (create.sql / create_ind.sql - appears to be for Derby).    * Using a UUID as primary key appears to be a not extremely good idea.  ** While it can be argued that by definition the UUID is pretty unique, it still doe _not_ not come with a guarantee to be (http://tinyurl.com/6z94fcv ). Apart from the fact that the low probability does not say anything about _when_ the algorithm will produce a duplicate - it just how often duplicates statistically arise number of calls. ( Black swans do exist - even though statistically they appear to be non-existent ;-) )  ** When considering that the DDL creates the ID field (regardless of whether is should be a primary key or not!) as a {code}ID VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL{code}, one should note that for today's 128 bit UUIDs a field length of 36 characters would be sufficient. Note that databases - on the physical page level - are rather unhappy with variable length keys. With fixed length keys there are much more efficient when maintaining index / table spaces - esp. finding out, on which physical page a record / index entry can be found.  ** From perspective of the application, it can be fine to have this UUID as a column (if sized correctly), but it should not be a primary key, because - even with the length shortened as explained above, it will unnecessarily blow up the index space of the database. Instead, a serial (incrementable) number (like in SAM DB) would be a much better choice, because  *** unique key generation can be made safely inside a database transaction and will be extremely cheap - esp. when considering that with batch inserts the software could obtain the keys for all records in the insert batch with one minimal operation (e.g. when having to insert 20 records we just need to increment the sequence field by 20 once, close the transaction, assign the keys and insert our batch while in parallel another request would be save to allocate new IDs for the batch of records it tries to insert - so even multiple Event Logging server processes could work efficiently in parallel using the same database).  *** it takes much less space (and we are talking about a database where we have to expect large amounts of records) in the primary table *EVENTLOG* and the secondary table *EVENTLOG_CUSTOMINFO*  *** while we do not have a strict sequence order in all case, the records are still _pretty_ much in sequence order - which could simplify garbage collection (recurring clean up of tables which is put on the customer's shoulders for now ...) and increase the chance of database internal cache hits when sequentially processing records.    * Creating primary keys for secondary table *EVENTLOG_CUSTOMINFO* is unnecessarily inefficient (see also TESB-9724 !).   ** We should not require a sequence field here! Instead we should use a fixed length composite key of EVENT_ID (assuming that it's ""just"" a number) and a short _local_ sequence number we can generate on the fly when inserting the custom properties (as we know how many custom properties come with the EVENT record we just assign numbers from 1..<numberOfCustomProperties> ).   ** Consequently the sub ID field does not have to be long (we save space on the primary index). Using this composite key will also increase the probability that the database stores the dependent records for the custom info physically in the same or a nearby located database segment - so the chances of a database cache hit is increased.  ** With that kind of primary key, there's no need to add and maintain the additional index needed for joining *EVENTLOG* and *EVENTLOG_CUSTOMINFO* records - which again saves database space and provides more performance.    So, please, please, remove this technical dept from Event Logging. For SAM it's already much harder than here, because SAM is already out with the customers and any schema change would require a data migration for customer data. With event logging we could avoid this from the start.",2,1.4358658

TESB-13867,Export limitations for ESB 'Jobs',"Currently we see two issues which lead user to wrong actions and which we can (easily) prevent in our studio:    - Export of an SOAP Data Service (single operation) job. In some cases customers tried to export a single tESBProviderRequest job which implements a single operation as a single OSGi for ESB Runtime export. We should prevent exporting and publishing of these kind of jobs (which includes a tESBProviderRequest component ) completly as and export / publishing should only be done in the 'Service' node level on the Repository menu.    - Any ESB Job (e.g with tESBConsumer, tRESTRequest, tRESTClient should be limited to 'ESB for OSGi' & (for tESBConsumer and tRESTClient ) also 'Anonymous exports only. All other export options should be inactive / removed fromt eh Export Options combo box for these kind of ESB Jobs.    Changes also should be applied to commandline.    ",2,2.3762612
TESB-14017,Service Registry: Advanced assignment improvements,"There are some improvements to assignment tab in case consumer policies option is enabled.    1. Assignment.  - rename 'Consumer Policy Properties' to 'Consumer Policy Aliases'  - in the 'Consumer Policy Aliases' show default aliases as bold - for all records.    2. Advanced Settings.  - rename to 'Consumer Policies'  - in case 'Manage consumer policies' checkbox is checked - show table with the list of the aliases. Before we show list of the aliases in the assign dialog. Only for one alias it's possible to set default. It should be possible to add/delete/edit aliases. It should be possible to change 'default' alias. These aliases will be used for assignment in the 'Available policies' tab - see next point.    3. Available policies.  - before 'Assign' button add checkbox with list of available aliases + <provider> record.     By this we change way for assignment behavior:  - we do not need 'Advanced assignment' dialog anymore.  - if <provider> is selected - just create provider policy attachment,  - if any alias selected - create consumer policy attachment with selected alias.    Also we need to update DOCT-3357 to new implementation.",3,2.7495716
