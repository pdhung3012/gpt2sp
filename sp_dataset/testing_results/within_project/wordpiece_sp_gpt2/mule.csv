MULE-8518,Provide access to client certificate on 2-way TLS authenticated connections,When a 2-way TLS authenticated connection is created the client certificate should be exposed in the flow since it may be useful to use it to identify the client.    We are going to expose the client certificate ONLY (not the CA certificates) in the flow using a new inbound property http.client.cert.    The user can access the client principal by doing message.inboundProperties['http.client.cert'].getSubjectDN()    We analyse if there is any risk by exposing the certificate as an inbound property but we got to the conclusion that there's no risk since the client certificate is publicly available in general and it's not used for the communication encrypt  / decrypt.

If I don't attempt to monitor Mule ESB, the memory leaks don't appear to happen, though it's difficult to be sure without being able to monitor, but I presume that this is MBean/JMX instrumentation related.

So you will have to solve this issue by configuring <xa-transaction> on each endpoint with the appropriate transaction strategy.     {code:xml}     <service name=""myBridgeService"">       <inbound>         <jms:inbound-endpoint queue=""/queue/inbox"">           <xa-transaction action=""ALWAYS_BEGIN"" />         </jms:inbound-endpoint>       </inbound>       <outbound>         <multicasting-router>           <jms:outbound-endpoint queue=""/queue/outbox"">             <xa-transaction action=""ALWAYS_JOIN"" />           </jms:outbound-endpoint>           <jdbc:outbound-endpoint queryKey=""insertMessageStmt"">             <xa-transaction action=""ALWAYS_JOIN"" />           </jdbc:outbound-endpoint>         </multicasting-router>       </outbound>     </service>  {code}     But what happens now if you have a component between inbound and outbound enpoints ?    {code:xml}    <service name=""myDaoService"">      <inbound>        <jms:inbound-endpoint queue=""/queue/inbox"">          <xa-transaction action=""ALWAYS_BEGIN"" />        </jms:inbound-endpoint>      </inbound>      <component>        <spring-object bean=""messageDao"" />      </component>      <outbound>        <multicasting-router>          <jms:outbound-endpoint queue=""/queue/outbox"">            <xa-transaction action=""ALWAYS_JOIN"" />          </jms:outbound-endpoint>          <jdbc:outbound-endpoint queryKey=""insertMessageStmt"">            <xa-transaction action=""ALWAYS_JOIN"" />          </jdbc:outbound-endpoint>        </multicasting-router>      </outbound>    </service>  {code}    In most cases, the Spring object component (eg. messsageDao) will execute complicated business operations (from a currently existing business API) and also use a DataSource to execute several SQL select and update statements before returning a result to the outbound. These JDBC operations will be handled likely by Spring JdbcTemplate or even HibernateTemplate.    As far as I understand, Mule is fully responsible to handle enlistment/delistment and close of XA resources (see _org.mule.transaction.XaTransaction_). So by default, XA resources used by a Spring object component will not be handled by Mule and will not participate in the XA transaction started from Mule.    For completeness... I've also found a unit test for this usecase in Mule distribution under MULE_HOME/src/mule-3.1.2-src.zip/org/mule/test/integration/transaction/XATransactionsWithSpringDAO.java. When you execute this test, you will have a successful result but the XA resource used by the dao bean is not enlisted nor delisted in/from the transaction started from Mule. ",8,3.5815325

Also, in the proxy scenario (using a listener and a requester) connections are kept alive but not reused.

MULE-8786,"WSC with basic auth wraps ""error""s HTTP status code by throwing exceptions with timeouts","When using WSC in conjunction with HTTP Basic Authentication (through HttpRequesterConfig) when bad credentials are used in the basic auth, the output I see is a timeout [1] rather than an exception caused by a 401 or 403 status code error.    To reproduce so, I'm attaching a small SOAP server (demo-soap-server.zip) and a mule app to try it out [2]. The endpoint I'm hitting is http://localhost:9000/acme-crm/orders?wsdl where the valid credentials are  user: admin  pass: admin.    In the mule app there are two flows to be executed   * (a) http://localhost:8081/goodCredentials where once it's hit you will see something like the following in a browser  {code:xml}<ns2:CreateResponse><return>0</return></ns2:CreateResponse>{code}  * and (b) http://localhost:8081/badCredentials where once it's hit you will wait for the default timeout of the WSC to be consumed, seeing at the end the stack trace in the mule app [1].    The issue here is that, despite the app will fail because of bad credentials, the developer should be warn that the error was an unauthorized rather than timed-outed.

MULE-8821,Concurrent calls to the OAuth2 authorize MessageProcessor fail when passing different values for accessTokenUrl,"When the authorize MessageProcessor is invoked by 2 different users at the same time and each of those invocations is done with a different value for the accessTokenUrl, the access token request for one of them is made to the wrong url.    I am using the salesforce connector v6.2.1 and this is how my authorize call looks like:    <sfdc:authorize       display=""#[flowVars['display']]""       authorizationUrl=""#[flowVars['salesForceUrl'] + '/authorize']""       accessTokenUrl=""#[flowVars['salesForceUrl'] + '/token']""       config-ref=""sfdcConnectorConfig""       state=""#[payload]""       accessTokenId=""#[flowVars['remoteUserId']]"" />    The flowVar salesforceUrl can take 2 possible values, which are:  https://login.salesforce.com (Salesforce Production)  https://test.salesforce.com (Salesforce Sandbox)    When a user does the OAuth dance to login.salesforce.com at the same time another user does the OAuth dance to test.salesforce.com, one of the dances fail.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    I believe the problem can be found in the way the accessTokenUrl is retrieved and saved by these 2 processors (in mule-devkit-support):  - org.mule.security.oauth.processor.BaseOAuth2AuthorizeMessageProcessor<T>  - org.mule.security.oauth.processor.OAuth2FetchAccessTokenMessageProcessor    The BaseOAuth2AuthorizeMessageProcessor<T> (line 81) saves the accessTokenUrl value in the defaultUnauthorizedConnector object of the OAuth2Manager.  The OAuth2FetchAccessTokenMessageProcessor (line 57) obtains an OAuth2Adapter (used to fetch the access token) from the OAuth2Manager. The OAuth2Manager creates the adapter setting the accessTokenUrl (line 256 BaseOAuth2Manager<T>) with the value taken from the defaultUnauthorizedConnector object.    https://github.com/mulesoft/mule/blob/mule-3.5.2/modules/devkit-support/src/main/java/org/mule/security/oauth/processor/BaseOAuth2AuthorizeMessageProcessor.java#L81    https://github.com/mulesoft/mule/blob/mule-3.5.2/modules/devkit-support/src/main/java/org/mule/security/oauth/processor/OAuth2FetchAccessTokenMessageProcessor.java#L57    https://github.com/mulesoft/mule/blob/mule-3.5.2/modules/devkit-support/src/main/java/org/mule/security/oauth/BaseOAuth2Manager.java#L256    The defaultUnauthorizedConnector of the OAuth2Manager is common to all events and threads. I believe that when 2 users are doing the oauth dance at the same time the accessTokenUrl value of the defaultUnauthorizedConnector is being overwritten by the second user before the first is able to fetch the access token.",8,4.4486465
MULE-8822,OAuth2 Refresh token logic fails after restart for preexistent connection,"This issue is related to the problem encountered in JIRA MULE-8277.    After restarting an application that uses the Box Connector, the first time a box request is made with a preexisting Box connection, that has an expired access token in its OAuthState, a refresh token process is triggered that does not attempt to save the refresh and access token obtained from box in the connector's ObjectStore.    The Box connector postAuthorize method invokes one of the connector's processors in order to retrieve the id of the user after the OAuth2 dance for identification purposes. That request within the postAuthorize triggers the first refresh token process for the connector on its first use after restart.    The way to reproduce the issue would be:  - Run a mule application on mule 3.6.2 with the Box Connector and a persistent Objectstore for it  - Do the OAuth dance with a Box user using the authorize MessageProcessor.  - Wait until the Box access token expires or modify it in the OAuthState saved in the Objectstore to make it invalid  - Restart the mule application and attempt to run a Box MessageProcessor like <box:get-user /> twice. (The first attempt should refresh but not save and the second should fail to refresh)",5,4.3113155
MULE-8823,Unable to deploy Application in Mule 3.7.0,"Nowadays, if you want to create a proxy, you have to specify the port name and the soapVersion for each binding. This information is provided by the wsdl, so it shouldn't be required, the proxies should detect them automatically.    As a consequence, if you have an API with multiple ports, one of them receiving a SOAP 1.1 envelope, and other one receiving a SOAP 1.2 envelope, and if you don't specify the port and the soapVersion in both proxies (service and client) you will not be able to send a SOAP 1.2 message.

I tracked it down to the rethrowRuntimeException method in class org.springframework.util.ReflectionUtils:  	public static void rethrowRuntimeException(Throwable ex) {  		if (ex instanceof RuntimeException) {  			throw (RuntimeException) ex;  		}  		if (ex instanceof Error) {  			throw (Error) ex;  		}  		throw new UndeclaredThrowableException(ex);  	}  So it seems this involves all exceptions that are not RuntimeException or Error.",1,4.585928

CloudHub configurations such as Properties, Insight and Logging need to be reconfigured every time the application is deployed.

MULE-9168,Users should not be forced to use @Parameter to expose pojo fields,"In order to expose pojo fields users are force to annotate the each field with @Parameter.    When users consumes external jar, they cannot modify the code. Also if they generate java stubs from a WSDL using CXF, they will need to modify a huge amount of Pojos just to get this to work properly, and what is worst, if a new version of the WSDL goes out and you try to update your connector, you will lose everything after generating the new stubs.    The mechanism should be that if the Pojo has any field annotated with @Parameter, then the current logic is valid and should only expose those fields. However, if the Pojo has no @Parameter, every single field that has a gettter and setter should be taken into account (including nested pojo fields)",8,4.376736
MULE-9170,Implement a testing tool to check misusages of lifecycles,Allow a build to be run with a profile that fails tests when any of the following happen:    * lifecycle method is called more than once for a given object.  * dispose/stop method called without matching initialise/start having been called (if defined). Check for any possible combination scenarios.    Run the test suite with this tool enabled and verify any test failures caused by it. File a bug for each component that has a failure.

MULE-9211,Configurations should be able to have dynamic parameters which don't trigger dynamic configurations,"Currently, all configuration parameters with expression values are translated into a DynamicConfigurationResolver. This is fine for most cases    There're other cases though in which it's desirable to have dynamic values which shouldn't necessarily trigger a new config instance. For example, an FTP connector which needs to switch between ASCII and BINARY mode. It should be fairly easy to switch modes through the use of an expression, but we don't want to trigger new connection pools for each case. Only connection credentials should trigger that.    To enable this case, we can leverage the ValueResolver<T> object which already exists in the extension-support module.    The config can have:    {code:java}  @Parameter  private ValueResolver<String> transferMode;  {code}    and then when you want to get the value you go:    {code:java}  ftpConnector.getTransferMode().resolve(event);  {code}",8,3.2579978
