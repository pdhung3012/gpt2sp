At the moment, if the predicted date is infinity, we don't display a prediction. If the most pessimistic date is infinity, we display a flat line and cut the chart off after the predicted date.

A: The board will reflect the current estimation.     Q: What if the estimation uses time tracking? Will we calculate deviation in minutes, hours, days? How will this be reflected on the axis?

Q: What do we display if a projected line goes significantly into the future before it touches the scope line? Potentially this could be years into the future, but this isn't realistic to display.  A: The chart expands to display the most pessimistic date, unless it's infinity, in which case it expands to show the middle prediction. It could be years.     Q: What happens to the lines if the version has been released?  A: If the version is marked as released or if total scope = total completed scope then we shouldn't display a prediction.     Q: What happens to the lines if the ""predicted"" release date is moved to the past?  A: This should never happen.    Q: What happens if the release date is moved into the future?  A: Marking a version as released is separate from displaying a release date. Regardless of whether a release date is assigned, we will try to predict a date if total scope > completed scope and the version is not marked as released in JIRA.    Q: What if the release date is removed?  A: See above.    Q: What happens to the projected lines if issues are removed from the version (resulting in scope change) or deleted entirely (resulting in chart change without history)?

JSW-8667,Allow to set resolution in Simplified Workflow,"As Patrick, I want to be able to specify which statuses transitions to which trigger the resolution field to be set to done so that my issues have any resolution at all.    Solution    1. Allow for a tickbox per status, which makes the global transition to that status set the resolution to ""Done"".  2. Unmapped statuses will also display this information (not necessarily the option to change it)  3. During the conversion to simplified workflow, the user will be presented with the default choice of statuses from the ""Done"" column selected for the resolution but should be able to override it before finishing the conversion.    Note that this will help people who are migrating as well as ones who have already migrated to simplified workflow.    (!) Dev Notes (!)  Q: Is this changed in GreenHopper Configuration?  A: (/) Its board specific so its in board configuration.    Q: How do we display the valid options as a part of the simplify dialog?  A: (/) With a multi select combo box    Q: How many statuses can you tick?  A: (/) No Limit    Q: What happens if the user moves a status to another column?

JSW-8974,Wizard-like Create Board dialog,"As Patrick, I want to be guided when creating a board so I don't get lost in the process.    CoS:    - The dialog consists of three parts:  -- Board type (Scrum, Kanban)  -- Project/Filter (create new project, choose existing, specify saved filter)  -- leftovers: sample data on/off, workflow (JIRA vs GH Simplified)  - this dialog replaces the existing ones present in:  -- create new scrum board  -- create new kanban board  -- create new DIY board  -- the dialog available from the cog menu (incl Manage Boards)  - the ""DIY"" option is removed from the ""Getting Started"" screen as it is effectively obsolete  - if Scrum or Kanban mode is chosen from the ""Getting Started"" screen, then the wizard should start at step 2 (i.e. we already know if it's scrum or kanban)  - the text inviting you to create new project or choose existing on ""Getting Started"" needs rewording so it simply opens the dialog -- remove the two ""1"" and ""2"" things and replace with just ""1"".  - the link to create a sample project should be rewired to use the new wizard and take you directly to creating the project with sample data and workflow options already selected.    (!) Dev Notes (!)    Q: What if there are no existing projects to select?  A: Skip the step to choose and go straight to create new project    Q: What if there are no filters to select from?

A: menu link or button disabled; getting started text changes and does not show option to create    Q: What if there is a large number of existing projects?  A: Drop down is really long    Q: What if there are a large number of filters?  A: Drop down is really long    Q: What if the user does not have permission to see some/all filters?  A: They won't appear in the list    Q: Are selections persisted between board creations?  A: No    Q: Does scrolling through all the panes persist selections?  A: Back / Next through pages should persist selections    Q: Is there proper XSS escaping for filters and projects?  A: Yes    Q: What if the window is resized?  A: Dialog stays the same size    Q: Does the create button disable/spinner after pressed?  A: There is a spinner.    Q: What happens if the operation is cancelled after the create button is pressed?  A: Within the process the dialog just goes away and no board is created. After the final button is pressed the page will reload and go to board, no cancel button.     Q: Has this been checked from plan, work, and report? Manage Boards, Board Configuration, and Getting Started all the same?  A: Link will be in menu for Manage Boards, Plan, Work and Report.     Q: Will the dialog not render properly in some browsers?  A: No, it will always be beautiful.   A2: In JIRA 5.1, 5.2 the dialog has some differences as expected.",8,2.8386393
