DM-5869,Assessment of current state-of-the-stack diffim implementation,"The existing diffim implementation in the stack defaults to the (2000) version of the Alard/Lupton algorithm. Other recent improvements such as ""pre-convolution"", delta-function basis, model selection via BIC, others, seem to be implemented but are not turned on. We need a good understanding of the existing implementation so we can assess how straightforward it is to implement the ZOGY algorithm in real-space in the stack.",6,5.852687
DM-5870,Update testdata_subaru to support calib changes,Merging DM-5124 broke obs_subaru because the test data in testdata_subaru wasn't updated.  Fix it.,1,1.1651202
DM-5872,"Incorporate ""Bickerton algorithm"" for detecting & masking satellite trails","In [HSC-1272|https://hsc-jira.astro.princeton.edu/jira/browse/HSC-1272], [~bick] proposed an algorithm for detecting and masking satellite trails. This has undergone some review on HSC, but has never been incorporated into an HSC software or data release (and hence is not part of the ""HSC port"").    However: the algorithm is certainly relevant to LSST. Please convert it to work with the LSST stack.",5,4.630018
DM-5874,Produce document describing flavors of coadds,"[~zivezic] has requested a description of the different flavors of coadds, and the tradeoffs between the more experimental optimal coadds and the non-optimal standard ones.    I'll try to do this as both a presentation for the DMLT and a DMTN (with essentially the same content).    This will include a bit of toy-model simulation work to try to predict some of the tradeoffs; this could make the discussion quite a bit more quantitative and I have an idea for how to do it that is pretty easy.",10,2.8375971
DM-5875,Propose text for alternate galaxy models in DPDD,Write a paragraph or two describing alternatives to the constrained bulge+disk model currently in the DPDD.,1,2.8863475
DM-5877,Use Afterburners to clean up aperture correction logic,"This issue has several components; I'm combining them into a single issue because they need to be done atomically:   - Rewrite the base_ClassificationExtendedness SingleFramePlugin/ForcedPlugin as an AfterburnerPlugin (and remove the old versions).   - Move the ""applyApCorr"" subtask out of SingleFrameMeasurementTask and ForcedMeasurementTask, making it instead a subclass of their parent Tasks.   - Add afterburner subtask stages to ProcessCcdTask (within DetectAndMeasureTask) and the multiband tasks wherever measurement is currently being run.  The afterburner tasks should be run after aperture corrections are measured and/or applied.    After these changes, throughout the stack, whenever a MeasurementTask is run, we also run ApplyApCorrTask and AfterburnerTask (in that order), while possibly running MeasureApCorrTask immediately after the MeasurementTask.    This may or may not enable significant cleanups in DetectAndMeasureTask (I haven't looked closely).  If so, they should be done on this issue.    Given all the moving parts, it's important to check that the actual behavior of the pipeline (in the aperture correction and extendedness values) does not change, so it might be useful to start by creating some reference outputs to compare against.",6,2.8929405
DM-5878,Add chi plots to validate_drp output to compare nominal error,"Make histograms of Deltas / nominal error.    where ""nominal"" error is that reported by the pipeline.    Are they distributed with a sigma=1?",2,0.8734413
DM-5879,Remove use of Boost smart pointers throughout the Science Pipelines,Replace all use of Boost smart pointers through the stack with their standard library equivalents.    This will require an RFC.,10,4.896053
DM-5880,Audit use of Boost in the stack and remove it where possible,"Consider use of Boost in the stack, and investigate where it can be eliminated by using std library equivalents. Create tickets to remove it, then work on them.",10,1.7985682
DM-5881,Recover from processCcd refactor,"Now that DM-5771 is closed and processCcd runs again, get back to the point where the things are not just not crashing but are actually working correctly (given that this is a non-standard use-case).",10,3.4902656
DM-5884,Create MySQL account for monitoring,A MySQL account needs to be created in configuration procedure and on existing data on IN2P3 cluster in order to enable ELK access. MySQL password/secret has to be shared accross all containers.,4,2.7797718
DM-5885,Create a JSON file for monitoring stack,"Create a JSON or YAML file with:    - Qserv version  - libraries/deps version  - other idea welcome    This will interesting ""GROUP BY"" in monitoring tool (performance for each Qserv or xrootd version for example)",3,1.8939545
DM-5886,Provide ngmix-based MCMC galaxy fitting,"DM-2250 provided for ""simple"" fitting of galaxies in single frame measurement using ngmix. Extend this to fit galaxies using ngmix's MCMC sampling facilities. This may include defining a mechanism to store MCMC samples in source records.    This should be available through (an) lsst_apps (or _distrib) based meas_extension package(s).",60,2.701969
DM-5889,"Suppress gcc warnings about ""unused local typedefs""","We should add {{\-Wno\-unused\-local\-typedefs}} to our gcc options.  This cleans up the build significantly, because there's a flood of warnings of this type coming from boost.  If we suppress those, it might become possible to notice warnings that we care about.",1,2.583232
DM-5893,LSST the Docs Fastly should redirect /en/latest/ to /,"Previously we deployed documentation on Read the Docs. By default, Read the Docs would show the master version of documentation on ""/en/latest/"". Many links with that endpoint may already exist. We should configure Fastly to redirect such paths to ""/"".",1,2.4179177
DM-5894,LSST the Docs Fastly Courtesy Redirects for directory paths,Currently if a user browses {{example.lsst.io/v/main/some-directory}} instead of {{example.lsst.io/v/main/some-directory}} they will receive an error.    We should develop a scheme where Fastly can detect that such a path is a directory and redirect to the directory's index.html page.,4,1.7875755
DM-5897,Robustify coadd,"In running the processing from the Twinkles data challenge in DESC we found that it was very easy to use the wrong skymap when making a coadd.  Since the coadd code doesn't even make a cursory check that the coordinate system it is using is the same as that of the coaddTempExps, it is very possible to mess this up.    Adding a check that the coadd WCS is that of each input tempCoaddExp is would solve this.",2,3.0472565
DM-5898,Python EUPS package can use $PYTHON,The {{python}} eups package has a script that checks that the python being used is version 2.7. This script can optionally check {{$PYTHON}} rather than the python in the path but I am confused as to what that test is going to do for us. The problem is that {{sconsUtils}} uses {{python}} and most of the shebangs use {{/bin/env python}} (although shebang rewriting on all platforms could help with that). I think the check script should have the {{$PYTHON}} support removed due to excessive confusion.    It would also help if the check script worked with python 3 so that the wrong python could be caught.,1,2.2253904
DM-5900,Create psutil EUPS package,Add the python {{psutil}} package to the stack as {{python_psutil}}.,1,1.6349008
DM-5901,LTD Keeper: More Robust Edition purges,LTD Keeper needs to purge Fastly when an Edition is rebuilt. Currently the surrogate-key for the build is also used to cover editions. This means that the key needed to purge an edition is the same as that for an build. Hence purging an edition means that the system needs to purge the surrogate key of the previous build.    We're seeing situations where the surrogate key that Keeper is purging is not the one that needs to be purged. A more robust configuration would be for each edition to have a stable surrogate-key that can be unambiguously purged.    This ticket covers the following work:    # Diagnose the issue.  # Enable Alembic migrations for Flask (Flask-Migrate)  # Add a surrogate-key column to the Edition model  # Change the S3 copy rebuild code to change the surrogate-key header  # Change the rebuild code to purge based on the edition's surrogate-key.,3,3.5387726
DM-5903,Finish technical note on galaxy shear experiments,"In the review of DM-5447 we decided it made sense for [~jbosch] to take over finishing the technote, in particular providing an introduction and concluion with more context.",4,5.3181467
DM-5904,Create focus script,"In DM-3368, we stripped out the focus calculation since it's not camera-generic, and the scatter/gather isn't necessary for general processing.  We need to reinstate the focus calculation in its own scatter/gather script.",2,1.3794214
DM-5905,Refactor DipoleFitPlugin classification into separate Classification plugin,"Currently the new DipoleFitPlugin runs measurement and then classification from a single measurement method. The classification should be moved out to a separate plugin. This will require more information be stored in the measRecord, in order to do the classification separately. Given that complication, evaluate whether this is even worthwhile.",6,5.0106587
DM-5906,Remove qmeta::QueryId and use global qserv::QueryId,Remove the qmeta::QueryId and use the typedef of QueryId in global/intTypes.h instead. Also try to verify that QueryId is used instead of uint64_t where applicable.,6,0.726707
DM-5907,Replace the heap in ScanScheduler with a list.,"ScanScheduler is using heaps to order Tasks by chunkId. This makes it difficult to add Tasks to actively running chunks, which causes a significant delay to the start of query execution. Using a list of buckets of Tasks where each bucket is for one chunkId will make it easy to add Tasks to chunks being. Within each bucket it will still be necessary to order Tasks by tables used in the query.",9,2.4051259
DM-5908,Alter the worker thread pool to allow threads to leave the pool and continue.,There are times when it is desirable for a thread to continue but effectively leave the thread pool and be considered finished by the scheduler. util::ThreadPool needs to modified to do this.,9,2.7797158
DM-5909,"After the first result set is returned, have the thread leave the pool.","When large results are returned from the worker to the czar, the thread should leave the thread pool and the Task should indicate to the scheduler that it is done.   ",6,2.0154884
DM-5910,Add code to the czar to throttle incoming large results.,The czar needs code to limit the number of Tasks sending back large results at any given time.,9,2.8089395
DM-5911,Fix circular references in Mapper objects,"Whilst running tests with pytest and the new file descriptor leak checker it became clear that Mapper objects were not freeing their resources when they were deleted. In particular, the registry objects remained and the associated sqlite database files were opened. This led to pytest running out of file descriptors when large test suites were being executed.    The problem turns out to be the dynamically created map functions. These are created as functions (not bound methods) attached to an instance. Since they are not bound methods the instance object (self) has to be passed in to closure. This leads to self containing a reference to a function that contains a reference to self and this prevents the Mapper from ever being garbage collected (leading to all the resources being retained).    A short term fix is pass the mappers into the closures using {{weakref}}.    Eventually it would be nice to consistently make the {{map_}} items bound methods rather than attaching them as functions but that is beyond the scope of this ticket.",1,2.2818887
DM-5912,"Add ""everything"" scan",Add a low priority ScanScheduler to the worker to handle very slow scans or scans that do not  work well on the other schedulers.,3,1.8968803
DM-5913,Add ability for workers to switch slow queries to the everything scan.,Give the workers the ability to move user queries to the everything scan if they are taking too long to complete a Task or several Tasks.,9,2.2306101
DM-5914,Document planned implementation of toy model of Lupton(ZOGY),"Develop a better understanding of the planned implementation of ZOGY in real space by implementing the kernel correction in k-space and investigating its characteristics when transformed back into real space. Do this either symbolically (if possible) or numerically in an ipython notebook. First in 1-D, then in 2-D, both assuming a constant kernel. Include documentation in the ipython notebook describing the current understanding of how this will be implemented",6,5.400488
DM-5915,Decide how to rework afw:Wcs guts with AST,"Following the to-be-written recommendation for DM-4157, we plan to rework the guts of afw:Wcs to use AST. We need to decide how afw:Wcs will use AST, whether as a wrapper or as a complete replacement with AST.    The product is a design",8,1.359461
DM-5916,Decide how to rework XYTransform/GTransfo guts with AST,"We want to better connect our other transforms with the WCS system, which means reworking the guts of XYTransform/GTransfo to work with AST. This could involve making one or both of them a wrapper, complete replacement, or writing a converter that turns our transform object into an AST map or FrameSet.    The product is a design",10,1.8388232
DM-5917,Design an API for the new Wcs and Transform system,"We need to design a new API for the WCS/Transform system. This is somewhat independent of the question of how the low-level code is used: we want a clean and simple API that lets the components of the stack create, manipulate, use, and persist the necessary transformations. Related to this question is whether we will still need skyToPixel/pixelToSky or whether the necessary operations with those can be subsumed into some Frame-to-Frame transformation (e.g. pixel-to-pixel or tan-to-tan).    The product is an RFC",16,7.8934846
DM-5918,What transforms do we currently need?,"In order to use AST in the stack, we may need to add mappings to it. We also need to be able to describe our transforms at a high level so that we know how to create them.    We need a list of the currently necessary transformations (e.g. from afw:wcs, XYTransform, GTransfo and any other relevant stack packages), and some concrete ideas about the kinds of transforms we may need in the future. These should be described in a high-level mathematical manner, independent of our wcs/transform system.    This can be informed by DMTN-005 and the requirements section of DMTN-010",4,3.048849
DM-5919,Describe our composite mappings and transformation endpoints (Frames),"To use AST in the stack, we need to be clear what our different transformations (AST:Mappings) and endpoints (AST:Frames) are going to be so we can create the chain of transformations (AST:FrameSets) that will be used throughout the stack. This applies to both images and CameraGeom. We may want to produce similar descriptions for other stack objects.    This ticket is the high-level Frames equivalent to the mathematical Mapping description in DM-5918.    This will help us determine how we can put our current input/output image frames into the new system.",4,3.828657
DM-5920,Create DCR metric using new dipole measurement,"In order to evaluate DCR correction algorithms we need a metric that defines the severity of DCR in a residual image. This ticket is to run the new dipole measurement task on simulated difference images affected by DCR, and to define a useful metric. The result will be a brief technical note defining the process and the metric, with a few examples.",6,6.842978
DM-5921,Clarify how to work with ci_hsc's astrometry_net_data,"ci_hsc's {{README.rst}} contains [a note|https://github.com/lsst/ci_hsc/blob/87b6ecb1cc0157cac8dafb356520f49f971bb1ec/README.rst#reference-catalog] on declaring & setting up the included reference catalogue data.    I believe this was rendered obsolete by DM-5135, which automatically sets up the reference catalogue when ci_hsc itself is set up. Attempting to follow the documentation therefore produces confusing warning messages, and may break things.    Please check if my understanding is correct and, if so, fix the documentation.",1,2.217921
DM-5922,Rework camera geometry to use the replacement for XYTransform,"As part of overhauling XYTransform we will likely need to replace the way we describe the transformations supported by camera geometry and {{Detector}}. This is likely to include a new way of describing the coordinate frames (e.g. {{PIXEL}}. {{FOCAL_PLANE}} and {{PUPIL}}).    If we adopt AST (as seems likely) then these frames will be AST {{Frames}}, the transforms will be AST {{Mappings}} and the collection described by {{Camera}} and {{Detector}} will be one or more AST {{FrameSets}}.    An RFC for the redesigned API for camera geometry will be required and this ticket is to implement the resulting design.",8,5.3317075
DM-5923,Support arbitrary sky rotation angles in StarFast,"Currently, if a region of sky is simulated in StarFast the stars must always have the same x,y coordinates (before DCR effects). This ticket is to support arbitrary rotations and offsets of the simulated stars to mimic realistic repeated observations of the same field.",2,2.964693
DM-5924,Improve overscan correction,"Overscan correction can be improved.  Specifically, some systems have sharp discontinuities in the bias section.",6,3.036182
DM-5925,Implement fringe correction in ISR,There is an initial implementation of fringe correction in the obs_subaru package.  It should be ported and generalized.,6,3.1887128
DM-5926,networking in strange state for newly created instances,"When starting a new instance, occasionally something strange seems to happen with the  network setup.  The instance will come up but is inaccessible (icmp, ssh). When this happens, the console log shows that a DHCP address was obtained and cloud-init injected ssh-keys, so it isn't a total network setup failure.    I have seen this happen a few times in the last couple of weeks but I can't reliably reproduce it.  I'm wondering if neutron is logging anything interesting when this happens.    This failure mode happened  again a few minutes ago with 7adffa82-7221-454c-acfe-5f21cdd34ea8.  Which I killed and recreated as instance b6f64981-099b-46e5-a27e-e3694372f447 with the same private IP address.   The new instance is accessible as expected.",1,2.493578

DM-5931,Test planned implementation of Lupton(ZOGY) algorithm in real space,Develop a (1-D?) simple toy model and test the effects of the correction for varying I1 and I2 noise levels and different image PSFs and matching kernel(s).

DM-5932,Trial implementation of Lupton(ZOGY) in stack,The Lupton reinterpretation of the ZOGY algorithm in real-space is essentially a post-convolution that implements noise whitening (or decorrelation) of the image difference. We will make a first-pass at implementing this in the existing diffim codebase in order to perform future evaluations on real data.,16,4.2912226
DM-5933,Replace jointcal.StarSelector with meas_algorithms.starSelector,jointcal has its own custom star selector. This should be removed and replaced with a star selector based on meas_algorithms.starSelector. A good choice might be meas_algorithms.objectSizeStarSelector.,2,2.5615015
DM-5934,Update developer guide with Astropy guidance,Once RFC-178 is adopted the developer guide has to be updated to include guidance as to how Astropy can be used in the stack (similar to how Boost is documented).,1,2.468046
DM-5935,Package Astropy for the stack,Once RFC-178 is adopted Astropy needs to be packaged in an EUPS container. Given the complexity of Astropy dependencies the packaging will be done as for {{numpy}} and {{scipy}} by checking that Astropy is available (v1.1 will be the minimum version).,1,2.3426967

Supported formats: eps, jpeg, jpg, pdf, pgf, png, ps, raw, rgba, svg, svgz, tif, tiff.  {code}    In matplotlib 2.0 prerelease the file is saved as a png when an unknown extension is specified. Since the write call success the unit test fails as it is expecting a failure.     If nothing depends on this behavior, the unit test should probably be removed.",1,2.7590659

DM-5941,Private network not available across all instances,"I'm setting up an ELK system. Part of that is an Elasticsearch system. When I bring up the system the private network is bisected. I attempted creating a security group, in case that was a problem but it didn't help. Note that the work around is to create security groups or use a firewall and use floating ips. This is far from ideal. I think the right solution is to use the private network.

DM-6030,Investigate possibilty of cosmic ray muons (etc) for precision gain calibration,"In the era of CBPs, we care about absolute system throughput, and thus need to accurately know the gain of amplifiers in the CCDs.    Initially, this can be done by lab-based Fe55 characterisation (modulo the non-linearity, though that itself will need to be need to be characterised and corrected for), but changes in the relative gains of the various amplifiers need to be monitored, and this must be done in a way that is not degenerate with the optical transmission in any way.    Theoretically it should be possible to use cosmic ray muon tracks, and tracks from radioisotope contamination of the glass/dewar, to measure the (change in the) relative gains of the amplifiers.    Early work has shown that this does work in principle, but this ticket is for some further effort to see whether this method can provide the necessary accuracy given the amount of data available remains to be seen.    This ticket would normally need to be significantly more points, but as it builds on earlier work, it can, at least for initial results, be done quite cheaply.    Initial investigation will inform further work.    1st order: histogram all pixels in dark images after careful bias subtraction. Look at shape of spectrum. Fit some arbitrary function, and correlate with Fe55 gain measurements.    2rd order: Separate muon tracks from soft electron tracks/nuclear recoil events. Can cutting one of more of these types out improve the correlation? Or can treating them separately improve the resolution?    3rd order: Recalculate the histogram in terms of the dE/dx for the muon tracks, i.e. taking into account their track lengths and thus angle through the silicon.",10,3.6895523

It is difficult to enforce correctness because background is measured several times while processing an exposure.    To solve this, pass the background directly to `NoiseReplacerTask`.

Note that this applies to tasks LSST provides in its stack, not to variants users produce and other obscure one-off code.    Also document the desire that tasks with anticipated many variants, such as star selectors, and PSF determiners should be in registries. This explicitly excludes tasks such as ISR where only one task is likely to be useful for a given set of data.  ",2,2.8201926

From this I conclude that the aperture corrections are indeed being measured for all but the final entry in the plugin list.  This implies that the report of ""Only 0 sources for calculation of aperture correction for 'xxx_xxFlux'; setting to 1.0"" is incorrect for all but the final plugin measurement.

The catalog search panel will need to be adapted to display this table constraints to fully complete the search query options.    The implementation:  It contains the redesigned panel based on IRSA current OPS catalog search. A table with input constraints and sql area input are added.   There is a lot in that PR. In particular, usage of table renderers and 'fieldgroup' together with a changed BasicTable component to be able to get the value from input field custom column 'constraints'.

You will know that you are successul when you ssh into the container as the qserv worker user and the ""limit"" command tell you have can lock lots of memory.

This should also include an estimate of the overall performance relative to the base A&L algorithm by examining runtime, false positive rate, and accuracy of noise estimation in both the detection threshold and the reported measurement SNR.",30,3.8150673
DM-6242,Study spatial variability of ZOGY correction,DM-6241 looked at how the correction term to the A&L algorithm performs under the simplifying assumption that the science image PSF is spatially invariant (though the matching kernel is spatially varying).  This epic will focus on how to extend the correction to include spatially varying terms.,38,4.5829687
DM-6243,Study the impact of having a spatially invariant decorrelation correction factor to A&L,The initial implementation of the A&L + noise whitening correction term assumes a single matching kernel and variance value(s) for the image(s) in the correction kernel.  We should assess how well that assumption performs in simulated and real images.  One test would be the variance and covariance in the noise as a function of position in a set of typical images.,8,3.6826153
DM-6244,Assess performance of the decorrelation correction to A&L,"Study the performance when using the (currently, spatially invariant) correction term to the base A&L algorithm in terms of runtime, detection threshold, reported measurement noise, and false positive rate for similarly tuned versions of both the base algorithm and that with the correction applied.",6,3.0356665
DM-6245,Compare competing algorithms for correcting DCR in template images,DM-5455 provides an implementation of a correction algorithm that depends on a matrix inversion approach to correct for DCR.  This should provide another approach for comparison (potentially a more forward modeling based approach).    Compare the algorithms in a simplified system in 2-D where DCR is along one axis.  The algorithms should be extended to arbitrary rotations.  The bakeoff will be repeated in the case of arbitrary rotations.    The result should be a recommendation as to the algorithm to use for DCR correction in template images.,49,2.010225
DM-6246,Vertical overscan off by one again,"In DM-5524 [~price] fixed the vertical overscan by directly editing the amp info catalogs, but didn't mark the camera generating code as bad. In DM-6147 I regenerated the files, reintroducing the problem. The problem seems to be a subtle bug in the camera generating code. Rather than try to fix it, I'll convert the fixed catalogs directly and mark the generating code as broken. [~price] will issue an RFC that suggests a better way to handle generating amp info and once that is dealt with we can come up with a more permanent fix (e.g. delete the generating code or fix it).",1,2.294439

DM-6278,Investigate proper precision for afw::image::Image pixel transforms,"The various pixel based transforms in {{afw/src/image/Image.cc}} were converted from using {{boost::lambda}} to C++11 lambda per DM-6091.    At many places the previous implementation contained implicit casts (through {{boost::ret}}) of intermediate results to {{PixelT}} (e.g. {{float}}).  In particular this affects opperations such as {{result = l + c*r}} where {{l}} is the left hand side image, {{r}} is the right hand side image and {{c}} a {{double}} constant.  When calculated at double precision (e.g. without the casts, which are not needed with C++11 lambdas) the result is slightly different and this causes {{tests/testProcessCcd.py}} to fail on {{self.assertAlmostEqual(psfIyy, 2.17386182921239, places=7)}} which is only equal up to the fifth place.    In order to not break existing behaviour I added explicit casts to {{PixelT}} for intermediate results. But this approach is questionable as the end result will be less accurate then possible. The aim of this ticket is to decide which approach is best:    1. Calculate at full precision and modify the test case.  2. Cast intermediate results to final precision (as it is done now).  3.

These scripts are still part of the obs_* packages, and some people rely on them for making changes to the camera description. On the other hand, the generated FITS files and python file are also first-class members of the obs_* packages. This means that we have two sources of the same information, which is dangerous.    For obs_lsstSim, obs_decam, obs_cfht and obs_sdss, we want these scripts to be the primary source of information.  This means we should delete the generated files, and create them at build time.  We should also standardise the name of the script used to generate these.",3,3.0830748

DM-6490,Investigate calibration zeropoint offset between HSC vs. LSST processCcd.py runs,"As reported in DM-4730, while the scatter between single frame processing measurements of the same dataset on the HSC vs. LSST stacks is quite good (rms = 0.009 mag between Gaussian fluxes, for example, in the figure shown on that ticket), there is a clear offset (0.0166 mag in the figure shown) in the zeropoint between the two stacks (it is systematic, i.e. no trend with magnitude).  The cause may well be due to slight differences in the reference stars selected for calibration.  We also speculated about differences in slot definitions used in the calibrations steps (e.g. for aperture corrections, psfex, etc...), so I have rerun visit 1322 through both stacks having forced all apertures used in calibration to be the same, namely a circular aperture of 12 pixels measured using the sinc algorithm (as opposed to ""naive"").  I have attached the *processCcd.py* config files for the two runs so my settings can be reproduced.    Also of note, I am using a {{meas_algorithms}} branch on the HSC stack with the following commit:    {code}  commit 173ad0b32ed4f4ab074f1a942d2d3f758e189917  Author: Lauren MacArthur <lauren@astro.princeton.edu>  Date:   Wed Jan 13 16:35:59 2016 -0500        Hack to allow flux.aperture to be used in apCorr            Since it does not seem possible to access the nth element of a      schema element that is an array in the context of setting a config      override, this allows for flux.aperture to be set as      calibrate.measureApCorr.reference and it sets it to index 4 (which      corresponds to a radius of 12 pixels) in the __init__.  This was      selected to match the current LSST default.    diff --git a/python/lsst/meas/algorithms/measureApCorr.py b/python/lsst/meas/algorithms/measureApCorr.py  index 9f6c599..f1fa99d 100644  --- a/python/lsst/meas/algorithms/measureApCorr.py  +++ b/python/lsst/meas/algorithms/measureApCorr.py  @@ -81,6 +81,9 @@ class MeasureApCorrTask(lsst.pipe.base.Task):       def __init__(self, schema, **kwds):           lsst.pipe.base.Task.__init__(self, **kwds)           self.reference = KeyTuple(self.config.reference, schema)  +        if self.config.reference == 'flux.aperture':  +            print ""NOTE: setting aperture correction flux to flux.aperture[4] ==> radius = 12 pixels""  +            self.reference.flux = self.reference.flux[4]           self.toCorrect = {}  {code}    I attach some of the figures comparing the PSF fluxes from these runs which compare the output of the two stacks having matched the two src catalogs.  There are two sets: 1) having adjusted the flux for each source to the zeropoint calculated in the calibration and stored as *FLUXMAG0* 2) having adjusted the flux for all sources to a common zeropoint (zp=33.0, chosen to roughly match the calibrated zp).  Note that my figures do include aperture corrections (in DM-5301, many of the plots show fluxes pre-aperture correction).  I have also included plots that directly compare the aperture corrections applied (difference in mag units).  Finally, I also include plots comparing the 12 pixel circular aperture mags (i.e. to which no apCorr is added).    Clearly, the zeropoint determined in the calibration of the two stacks differs between the two stacks and, in particular, there seem to be some very problematic CCDs where the differences are particularly significant (~0.05 mag, and not always in the same direction).  Please investigate the source of this discrepancy.",8,1.7346518
DM-6491,Investigate offset in baseline zeropoint between LSST vs. HSC stack reductions for some HSC visits,"DM-6490 reports on an offset between the calibration zeropoints between HSC vs. LSST *processCcd.py* runs.  Here we report another, additional, offset seen in certain HSC visits.  It is not seen in the figures shown in DM-6490 for visit 1322.  However, here attach the same figures for visit 19696, run with identical setups/configs for both stacks as in DM-6490, where we see an additional offset in the ""common ZP"" figures (i.e. all fluxes have been scaled the same zp=33.0 for comparison).    A best guess at present is that the calibration frames are different between the HSC and LSST stacks for the timeframe of this visit; e.g. were the inputs ingested exactly the same for both sets?  Did the bug in regards to flagging on the flats noted in DM-5124:  {quote}  I found a difference in the codes doing the statistics: the HSC code uses a hard-coded mask ignore list of DETECTED only, while the LSST code uses a configurable mask ignore list that defaults to DETECTED,BAD (and the default isn't overridden). This produces a large difference on CCDs with bad amps (e.g., ccd=9).  There's a smaller difference on ccd=49 because the number of BAD pixels is smaller. Also note that the scaling of one CCD (like ccd=9) can affect others because we force the normalisations to correspond to that which we get from solving the system of M exposures of N CCDs.  {quote}  have a greater impact on these calibs?    Please investigate the cause of this offset.",8,2.0246837

However, when HSC data is processed without bright object masks available (as will happen in most GO observations and development use), multiBandDriver.py will fail because the BRIGHT_OBJECT mask plane is not present but the base_PixelFlags algorithm is configured to make use of it. This is confusing, and it also requires the definition of a configuration file to fix the problem because base_PixelFlags cannot be configured directly on the command-line.    Some possibilities for fixing this:   - Add the BRIGHT_OBJECT mask plane in AssembleCoadd if doMaskBrightObjects is True but the external catalog is not found.  This will make the PixelFlags operation a silent no-op.   - Allow configuration options to allow PixelFlags algorithm to silently skip some flags if the appropriate masks are not available.    I am sure there are other options as well.  ",2,2.7681117

The fix is to make the butler argument optional (with a default of None), while adding another argument that allows a fully-constructed reference object loader to be provided directly instead.    This is closely related to DM-6597, which has the opposite problem: pipe_drivers' {{SingleFrameDriverTask}} doesn't take a butler argument, but it needs to in order to provide one to {{ProcessCcdTask}}.

DM-6815,Update LSST full-stack processing configuration to match best practice from HSC,"In preparation for running an end-to-end comparison of large scale processing with the HSC and LSST stacks, we need to update the configuration to reflect currently understood best practice.    In general, we expect the default HSC configuration to be better understood and ""battle-tested"" given that it has been used for science-grade data releases.    Audit the default configuration of the full LSST stack (from ProcessCcdTask through multiband coadd processing). Where LSST defaults differ from HSC, update the LSST configuration to match the HSC equivalent unless there's a clear reason why LSST's default should be different. When it's not appropriate to update the LSST configuration, add an override to obs_subaru.    In some cases, the LSST and HSC stacks have diverged so that a direct transfer of configuration options isn't possible. Where an equivalent can be found, take advantage of it. Otherwise, stick with existing LSST defaults.",10,1.4359341

DM-6830,Investigate effects of turning on the Brighter-Fatter correction for single-frame processing of HSC data,"In the process of comparing HSC vs. LSST stack single-frame processing runs, we have been running with the Brighter-Fatter correction (BFC) turned off.  The reason for this to begin with was that is was not yet available on the LSST stack when we started these comparisons.  We also want to isolate as many features as possible in order to confidently assess their individual effects  The functionality was ported on DM-4837 with a default of *doBrighterFatter=False*.  This issue is to continue the single-visit run comparisons (see e.g. DM-5301, DM-6490, DM-6491) with BFC turned on on both stacks.    In particular, we are finding that slight differences in the reference stars selected for a given CCD can result in significantly different psf models.  Also, it was noted in DM-4960 that LSST seems to select reference stars to a brighter cutoff than HSC.  If a given field has a larger fraction of bright stars considered in the psf modeling, it is conceivable that it will be more significantly influenced by the BF effect, thus causing the large CCD-to-CCD variations seen in, e.g. DM-6490 (https://jira.lsstcorp.org/secure/attachment/28213/compareVisit-v1322-diff_base_PsfFlux-skyZp.png).",6,4.3120384

Formulating  a response required a review of the service offered by AWS, and inquiring about the validity of pursing an evaluation of just one vendor in a marketplace that has many vendors, and a deciding that an appropriate amount of work was to send additional NCSA staff to an AWS workshop to gain a similar appreciation of AWS as was gained at the database meeting at SLAC.  (Authority of interim project manager to insist on immediate action was also sorted out)    2) Request to understand computing capabilities at alternate site from the Deputy director.  Support for for alternate site capabilities are documented in the  the emerging L2 Batch concept of operations a copy of which was shared (though draft status noted)     3) Processed a summary of the Camera meeting which occurred at SLAC. Did not find  conclusions that related to a concept of operations.

DM-6964,Make a proposal for API support for representation of relationships between table columns,"End users and the SUIT need to be able to determine a variety of relationships between columns in the tabular data products produced by LSST.  The particular example motivating this ticket is the need to answer the question ""where in the table is the uncertainty data for column 'x'?"".    The answer could be:  * ""there isn't any""  * ""a symmetric Gaussian uncertainty is in column 'sigma_x'""  * ""asymmetric Gaussian uncertainties are in columns 'sigmaplus_x' and 'sigmaminus_x'""  * ""'x' is correlated with 'y' and the covariance matrix is in 'covar_xx', 'covar_xy', and 'covar_yy'""     Ideally we would find a way for these relationships to be defined when the Apps code generates its afw.table outputs, discoverable through an API usable in the afw.table context, exportable to the database, and made available to end users and the SUIT.  It should be usable whether the data are delivered to end users as reconstituted afw.table objects or as tables in common Python formats (at least Astropy tables).    It should assist the SUIT in determining how to (automatically, though optionally) display uncertainty data when the primary data are requested.    This ticket expresses the idea that a solution that consists purely of a documented convention about prefixes to the string names of columns is inadequate.

For this use case multiple ""source""/""setups"" on a node/against the file system  can be avoidable by using a script to directly declare the environment.  run_orca /ctrl_orca supports this feature.       While GPFS is coming soon, there is expected to be a transition period of 2-3 months and so the NFS file system and a stack on it can serve users for an interim period.

DM-6998,Problems with MemoryTest ordering,"{{MemoryTestCase}} (or a derivative thereof) must be run as the last of all tests in a module in order to properly catch leaks.

This works for py.test, but not when using plain old unittest: the latter does not, so far as I can see, guarantee any sort of ordering as a matter of principle, and, in practice, it sorts things lexicographically (it uses whatever order it gets from running {{dir()}} on the test module, and I don't *think* that's guaranteed to be anything in particular).

DM-7040,Stars selected by starSelector change when number of cores varies,"Sogo Mineo writes in [HSC-1414|https://hsc-jira.astro.princeton.edu/jira/browse/HSC-1414]:  {quote}  See the following lines:    meas_algorithms/HSC-4.0.0/python/lsst/meas/algorithms/objectSizeStarSelector.py:466  in ObjectSizeStarSelector.selectStars():  {code}      if psfCandidate.getWidth() == 0:          psfCandidate.setBorderWidth(self._borderWidth)          psfCandidate.setWidth(self._kernelSize + 2*self._borderWidth)          psfCandidate.setHeight(self._kernelSize + 2*self._borderWidth)  {code}    In reduceFrames, these lines set the width of psfCandidate to be 21  for the first time the execution reaches there.    When the first CCD image has been processed, the worker process  continues to process another CCD image, and the execution reaches  here again.  This time, psfCandidate.getWidth() is 41, because  psfexPsfDeterminer has set it to be 41, and the value has been  retained because the width is a static member.  And so, for the second  CCD image, the width of psfCandidate is not 21 but 41.    Since psfCandidates are widened, stars positioned at edges of images  are rejected.  It results in a smaller number of PSF candidates than expected.    Only CCD images that are initially given to the worker processes  are processed with psfCandidate.getWidth() == 21. The other CCD images are  processed with psfCandidate.getWidth() == 41.  When the number of SMP cores changes, CCD images are processed with different  parameters.    The change in the number of PSF candidates results in different Psf, a different  result of image repair, and different catalogs.  {quote}    The line numbers are different on the LSST side because of refactoring (objectSizeStarSelector.py:466 has moved to starSelector.py:148), but the bug is still present.  The main problem appears to be that the {{PsfCandidate}} elements are {{static}}, are being set in both the star selector and the PSF determiner and one of those is conditional on what the value is.

(You have to click on the border of the plot to make it active, clicking inside does not help.)    This seems to cause strange behavior, when selections do not work as expected. For example: select ruler, select some lines alternating first and second plot. Unselect ruler, select area icon. Selecting in the first plot will still show distance. I had to delete distance tool drawing layer or click on the border for things to start showing area selection.    In general, there is some confusion with active plot, when I have two viewers. Should a plot become active as soon as mouse enters is? Otherwise in readout, compass thumbnail will still show active plot, while readout thumbnail could use another plot.  _note from trey: this is the same problem as the marker/footprint in atlas described aboved_",4,6.2511363
