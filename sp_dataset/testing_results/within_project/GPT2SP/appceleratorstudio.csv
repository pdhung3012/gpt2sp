TISTUD-6833,Android modules are not recognized as Java projects,"h3. Summary  As of the release of Titanium (& Studio) 3.3.0, old Android modules project had to be recreated (the structure having changed, the new build scripts wouldn't build an project created previously).    However, new projects, even though they ""build"" through the script, are not proper Java projects anymore and can not be worked on via Titanium Studio. Even when imported in ADT they are pure ""text"" projects and no autocompletion or syntax validation is available anymore.    h3. How to reproduce  Having properly installed the following SDKS :   Android 4.4.2, Android 4.1.2, Android 2.3.3  And having the NDK installed and properly configured in studio.    From an empty workspace, when you create a new Android module (in the example named bob, with id com.bob), everything seems to work fine, no errors are displayed during the creation and you now get a structure where source files are in android/src/com/bob folder :    !AndroidModuleBug.png!    The Java files no longer appear as part of a *package*.  There are *no jar* dependencies shown.  It's not even a *proper Java project* anymore.    I have removed a "";"" in the screenshot to show that the *syntax validation* didn't pick it up.  When using *autocomplete*, you get the following message (cf. screenshot) ""This compilation unit is not on the build path of a Java project"".    When removing the fake syntax error, the module packages fine, however it can no longer be worked on properly : no proper Java editing, have to ""guess"" all the fields.    I have reinstalled Titanium Studio from scratch to make sure it was not related to a problem in the update mechanism.    This is a complete nightmare for me since I have no longer the capability of editing my Android modules on my projects.",5,4.9350705
TISTUD-6784,Don't require install of Titanium SDK if path to SDK in preferences is bad,"I get prompted to install Titanium SDK as required in my dev eclipse. In that workspace I had a bad path to Titanium SDK root somehow, so I was getting prompted to install the SDk as required since no SDks were detected. I was unable to get rid of the update dialog to fix my SDK path setting (and some other bug around the sudo prompt was occurring, so I couldn't even install). In effect I had to restart and then quickly set my Titanium SDK path in preferences before the dialog popped up.    I think if there's a non-null Titanium SDK path in the user's prefs and it's not pointing at a valid SDK location, we may want to make the Titanium SDK install not be required. I'm not sure how often this happens in ""the real world"", but when it happened it was a very bad experience.",5,4.2772985

We couldn’t reproduce it locally for 6909, but were able to test and fix based on the user’s ti info output.

TISTUD-7682,Update Windows SDK Preference Page to use Windows Publisher ID,"We've had to make a change to some of the config/command line values we use for Windows SDK.    Basically before there was a Windows Phone Publisher GUID (-G) that was required. We ended up never actually using that, and it was a holdover from the Win 8 Mobile Web hybrid app stuff. Now that value and config value are optional, not required. It's used to specify the old Windows 8 publisher ID that MS assigned you, in the scenario that you're publishing an ""upgraded"" version of the app for Win 8.1/10.    There's now a ""sister"" config value/option called the WIndows Phone product id for the same upgraded 8->8.1 app scenario. It's to specify the old Win 8 app id. see https://github.com/sgtcoolguy/titanium_mobile_windows/blob/master/cli/commands/_build/config/wpProductId.js  Again that's optional. I think it's ok to not surface either of these two config/command line options because they'd be used extremely rarely by our customers. (plus one is more global - the Win 8 publisher GUID, while the other is app-specific - the Windows Phone product id).    The important change is likely to make the pref page handle showing/editing the new Windows publisher Id config value now (in place of the Windows Phone Publisher GUID we discussed above that it currently surfaces).

TISTUD-7981,Use appc daemon to request system info,"Appcelerator Studio will no longer need to call {{ti info -t <platform>}} a bunch of times each minute. With the appc daemon, Studio can simply connect to the server over a WebSocket and query the system information as well as listen for changes.    The appc daemon will ship with the appc cli, so Studio will not need to worry about installing the appc daemon. However, Studio will need to make sure appcd is running before trying to connect to it. If appcd is already running, the start operation immediately returns successfully.    Note: appcd isn't guaranteed to be globally installed. You will want to manually invoke it by calling {{node /path/to/appcd start}}.    This applies to all platforms: OS X, Linux, and Windows.    Studio will need to open a WebSocket to 127.0.0.1 port 1732. Once the socket is open, it will need to send a request using the appcd protocol. It's pretty simple. To kick off a request, Studio needs to send a stringified JSON object containing a {{version}}, {{path}}, {{id}}, and optionally a {{data}} payload.    Here's the JavaScript equivalent:    {code}  socket.send(JSON.stringify({      version: '1.0',      path: '/system-info',      id: '0'  });  {code}    The ""version"" must be {{1.0}}.    The ""path"" can be {{/system-info}} to get the info for ALL supported platforms (i.e. Android & iOS on OSX, Android & Windows on Windows, Android on Linux). The ""path"" may also contain the specific platform such as {{/system-info/ios}} or even platform specific info such as {{/system-info/ios/devices}}.    The ""id"" must be a string containing a unique request id. It can be a sequential number (cast as a string) or a UUID. The purpose of the ""id"" is that a single WebSocket can service multiple simultaneous requests and ""id"" is the only way you can match up the response with the initial request. For example, the appcd client generates a UUID for each request and then registers that UUID with an event emitter so that responses to the request ID are emitted to the code that made the request. Studio can use whatever mechanism it wishes to match responses with requests.    The ""data"" payload is optional. It's a JSON object containing additional information. It will allow Studio to specify additional request arguments and filtering options.    The response is a stringified JSON object containing an {{id}}, {{data}}, and possibly a {{status}}.    If the latest appc cli is not installed, and thus appc daemon is not installed, then Studio should continue to use the {{ti info}} method it does today.",8,4.597964

TISTUD-8012,"Studio needs to call ""appc run"" / ""ti build"" to build iOS/Android modules","Titanium SDK add support for building Titanium native modules via the CLI a while ago. It is suspected that Studio is still calling {{ant}} for Android modules and {{python build.py}} for iOS modules. These need to be updated to use the CLI.    To build Android modules, simply run:    {code}  appc run --platform android --project-dir /path/to/module/android --build-only    - OR -    ti build --platform android --project-dir /path/to/module/android --build-only  {code}    For iOS modules, run:    {code}  appc run --platform ios --project-dir /path/to/module/iphone --build-only    - OR -    ti build --platform ios --project-dir /path/to/module/iphone --build-only  {code}    Things to note:  * There should be no notable difference between using the Appc CLI vs Titanium CLI, but I could be wrong. Please advise.  * The {{\-\-project\-dir}} must be to the module's platform-specific directory.  * {{\-\-build\-only}} is only supported by iOS module build. Android support is coming in Titanium SDK 5.3.0 (TIMOB-20510).  * The {{build.py}} has been officially deprecated as of Titanium SDK 5.2.1 and will be removed from new module projects in Titanium SDK 6.0.0, possibly 5.3.0 or 5.4.0.  * Refer to TIDOC-2470 for more details.",5,4.6554613

TISTUD-8491,Android:Reconnect to the debug session after the app is restarted,"If a user attempts to debug a mobile app, then app initiates a debug connections during its startup. As Studio receives the debug connection request, it initiates the socket connection and receives the debug data. However, if the app is accidentally crashed/terminated on device or simulator, then the user has to re-launch the debug session (which will re-build the app and deploy onto device again).     If the app is restarted on the device (or simulator), then it attempts to make a debug connection to Studio, but Studio is no more listening to the debug connection requests. Studio should listen to the debug connection request even though the app is terminated/crashed, so that the user does not need to re-launch debugging the app again.",8,4.5109677
